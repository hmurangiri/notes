        <p>Let me explain my thought process on why I switched alcohol with energy drinks. I really enjoy hanging out kwa club, meeting friends, socializing and listening to music. There is immense entertainment and networking value in that environment. It clears my mind after a busy week and I couldn't stop doing something that makes me happy. I also realized that all disadvantages arise from alcohol consumption in clubs. The only way to get the benefits and avoid the drawbacks is continue clubbing but switch alcohol with something else. So nowadays, I still club, but take one or two monster drinks (max) na maji in between. Just like alcohol, huwezi kunywa energy drink kama juice. So:-
- Zero hangovers
- I'm extremely mobile because I don't care about alcoblow like drunk guys.
- I save a boatload of cash. Imagine using just 600-800 bob (max) kwa club. Pesa ungewaste kwa uber unasave pia. Imagine spending just 2400-3000 kwa club in a month and missing nothing. You literally save tens of thousands in a month compared to the drinker and yet you miss nothing.
- My productivity is unaffected. I don't waste the entire next day like I used to.
- No dumb decisions msee humake akiwa maji e.g altercations, revealing sensitive information, kuwekewa mchele etc.
- Zero risk of addiction or sliding into alcoholism.
- Alcohol is riskier juu nikikunywa energy drinks mbili in a week, I will be okay. Mlevi huenda club na plan ya kukunywa beer mbili anajipata amekunywa twelve. You can easily control the intake ya energy drink unlike alcohol. So, although both have health risks, in theory, in practice, alcohol is significantly riskier. In practice, the mlevi will not take two drinks in a week. He will take twelve and keep increasing as he builds tolerance</p><p>Let me explain my thought process on why I switched alcohol with energy drinks.
